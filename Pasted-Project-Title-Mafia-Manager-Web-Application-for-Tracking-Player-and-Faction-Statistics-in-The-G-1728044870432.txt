Project Title: "Mafia Manager"  Web Application for Tracking Player and Faction Statistics in "The Grand Mafia" game

Introduction:

"The Grand Mafia" is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game with over one million players globally. While the game provides extensive in-game statistics, it lacks tools for analyzing and comparing data over time. This gap makes it challenging for players and faction leaders to monitor performance, participation, and progress effectively.

Objective:

Develop a web application that allows players to:

    *Sign Up and Create Profiles: Users can register and securely log in to their accounts.
    *Track Battle Statistics Over Time: Input and save their gameplay statistics to monitor progress.
    *Analyze and Compare Data: Visualize changes in statistics between updates.
    *Faction Management: Create factions, invite members via unique codes, and allow faction leaders to            view and compare member statistics.

Key Features:

    User Registration and Authentication:
        Secure account creation and login.
        Passwords hashed for security.
        JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.

    Battle Statistics Tracking:

    Users can input and update the following battle statistics:
        Total Wins
        Total Losses
        Assaults Won
        Assaults Lost
        Defending Battles Won
        Defending Battles Lost
        Win Rate
        Kills
        Destroyed Traps
        Lost Associates
        Lost Traps
        Healed Associates
        Wounded Enemy Associates
        Enemy Turfs Destroyed
        Turf Destroyed Times
        Eliminated Enemy Influence

    Data Management:
        All updates are saved to maintain historical data.
        Users can compare new data with previous entries.
        Visual indicators (green/red arrows) show increases or decreases in statistics.

    Statistics Dashboard:

        Displays a table with three columns:
        Statistic	Current Value	Change Since Last Update
        (List of statistics)	(Latest data)	(Visual indicators)

        Highlights positive changes in green with upward arrows.

        Highlights negative changes in red with downward arrows.

    Faction Management System:

        Faction Creation:
            Users can create a faction and become its leader.
            Generates a unique invitation code for others to join.

        Joining a Faction:
            Members sign up and input the invitation code to join a faction.

        Faction Leader Dashboard:
            Leaders can view and compare statistics of all faction members.
            Facilitates tracking of participation in faction events.
